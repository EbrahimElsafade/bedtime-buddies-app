## âœ… COMPLETED: TypeScript Type Safety (Latest)
    [âœ“] Replaced all `Function` types with explicit function signatures
    [âœ“] Replaced all `any` types with proper interfaces and types
    [âœ“] Created type definitions: Language, Category, StorySection, FavoriteItem
    [âœ“] Fixed error handling with `error instanceof Error`
    [âœ“] Improved type safety across entire codebase

## Code Review - Critical Issues:

    [âœ“] Fix AuthContext session management (race conditions & deadlocks) ğŸ¡…ğŸ¡…ğŸ¡…
        - âœ“ Removed async Supabase calls from handleAuthStateChange
        - âœ“ Moved profile syncing to separate useEffect
        - âœ“ Removed sessionStorage backup mechanism
        - Multiple profile fetches causing performance issues
    [ ] Security: Sanitize error messages in Login.tsx ğŸ¡…ğŸ¡…ğŸ¡…
        - Line 214 displays raw error messages that could leak sensitive info
    [ ] Security: Remove console.error in production (Layout.tsx) ğŸ¡…ğŸ¡…
        - Line 35 logs errors in production environment
    [ ] Performance: Memoize debounce function in AuthContext ğŸ¡…ğŸ¡…
        - Non-memoized debounce creates new function on every render
    [ ] Performance: Optimize useEffect hooks ğŸ¡…ğŸ¡…
        - Redundant profile fetching
        - Multiple effect dependencies causing unnecessary re-renders

## Code Review - Code Quality:

    [ ] Refactor AuthContext - too many responsibilities ğŸ¡…
        - Split into smaller, focused hooks
        - Separate profile management from auth logic
    [ ] Remove commented-out debug logs ğŸ¡…
        - Clean up console.log statements throughout codebase
    [ ] Fix 'any' types in AuthContext ğŸ¡…

    [ ] Add rate limiting for auth endpoints ğŸ¡…
    [ ] Implement CSRF protection ğŸ¡…
    [ ] Add input sanitization library (DOMPurify) ğŸ¡…
