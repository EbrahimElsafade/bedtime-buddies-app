## Code Review - Critical Issues:

    [ ] Fix AuthContext session management (race conditions & deadlocks) 🡅🡅🡅
        - Async Supabase calls inside setTimeout in handleAuthStateChange
        - Fragile sessionStorage backup mechanism
        - Multiple profile fetches causing performance issues
    [ ] Security: Sanitize error messages in Login.tsx 🡅🡅🡅
        - Line 214 displays raw error messages that could leak sensitive info
    [ ] Security: Remove console.error in production (Layout.tsx) 🡅🡅
        - Line 35 logs errors in production environment
    [ ] Performance: Memoize debounce function in AuthContext 🡅🡅
        - Non-memoized debounce creates new function on every render
    [ ] Performance: Optimize useEffect hooks 🡅🡅
        - Redundant profile fetching
        - Multiple effect dependencies causing unnecessary re-renders

## Code Review - Code Quality:

    [ ] Refactor AuthContext - too many responsibilities 🡅
        - Split into smaller, focused hooks
        - Separate profile management from auth logic
    [ ] Remove commented-out debug logs 🡅
        - Clean up console.log statements throughout codebase
    [ ] Fix 'any' types in AuthContext 🡅
        - Replace with proper TypeScript types
    [ ] Design system: Fix hardcoded colors in tailwind.config.ts 🡅
        - ocean property uses hex colors instead of CSS variables

## Code Review - Security Recommendations:

    [ ] Add rate limiting for auth endpoints 🡅
    [ ] Implement CSRF protection 🡅
    [ ] Add input sanitization library (DOMPurify) 🡅
    [ ] Validate session expiry client-side 🡇
    [ ] Add security headers 🡇

## Code Review - Performance Recommendations:

    [ ] Implement React.memo for expensive components 🡅
    [ ] Add code splitting for routes 🡅
    [ ] Optimize image loading (lazy loading, responsive images) 🡅
    [ ] Implement virtual scrolling for long lists 🡇

## Code Review - Best Practices:

    [ ] Add Error Boundaries 🡅🡅
    [ ] Improve logging strategy (use proper logger in production) 🡅
    [ ] Enhance type safety (remove 'any' types) 🡅
    [ ] Add unit tests for critical functions 🡇
    [ ] Improve documentation (JSDoc comments) 🡇
